Cloud detection (CD) is one of the most critical metadata filters for searching, selecting, and accessing
imagery in Earth Observation (EO) platforms. In recent years, the extensive archive of EO datasets
has boosted the use of data-driven algorithms to improve cloud and cloud-shadow detection. However, 
data-driven algorithms require large manually annotated datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming
to collect. The first chapter of this diploma thesis introduce CloudSEN12, a new multi-temporal global dataset
created exploiting different EO datasets offered by the Copernicus program. CloudSEN12 has 49,400 image patches, 
including (1) Sentinel-2 level-1C and level-2A multi-spectral data, (2) Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar 
data, (3) auxiliary remote sensing products, (4) different hand-crafted annotations to label the presence 
of clouds and cloud shadows, and (5) the results from eight state-of-the-art cloud detection algorithms. At present, 
CloudSEN12 exceeds all previous efforts in terms of annotation richness, scene variability, metadata complexity, 
control quality, data distribution and size. In the second chapter, cloudSEN12 is used to analize how 
reliable is Sen2COR Sentinel-2 2A cloud mask. The results shows that ...
