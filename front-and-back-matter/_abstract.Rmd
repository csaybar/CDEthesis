Cloud detection (CD) is one of the most critical metadata filters for searching,
selecting, and accessing imagery in Earth Observation (EO) platforms. In recent
years, the extensive archive of EO datasets has boosted the use of data-driven
algorithms to improve cloud and cloud-shadow detection. However, data-driven
algorithms require large manually annotated datasets, which are expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The first chapter of this thesis introduce CloudSEN12, a
new multi-temporal global dataset created exploiting different EO datasets offered
by the Copernicus program. CloudSEN12 has 49,400 image patches, including
(1) Sentinel-2 level-1C and level-2A multi-spectral data, (2) Sentinel-1 synthetic
aperture radar data, (3) auxiliary remote sensing products, (4) different hand-
crafted annotations to label the presence of clouds and cloud shadows, and (5)
the results from eight state-of-the-art cloud detection algorithms. At present,
CloudSEN12 exceeds all previous efforts in terms of annotation richness, scene
variability, metadata complexity, control quality, data distribution and size. In
the second part, cloudSEN12 is used to establish the current state of the art in
cloud detection and cloud cover estimation for Sentinel-2 imagery. Furthermore,
we proposed directly estimating cloud cover using both a simple ResNet-18 and
a single forward pass uncertainty model. The results show that cloudSEN12
increases the efficiency of data-driven algorithms by at least 20%. In addition,
for the first time we analyze how credible is the estimation of uncertainty in
cloud detection models.
