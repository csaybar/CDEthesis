What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.

## Introduction
  
<!-- Introduction -->
Clouds contaminate nearly 0.65\% of the earth's surface regardless of time, with hotspots in tropics and subtropics regions (\cite{sassen2008classifying, winker2010calipso, Wilson2016}). Their effects on electromagnetic radiation signals vary according to different types of clouds. Grossly speaking, clouds may be classified depending on top height (CTH) and optical thickness (COT) properties (Figure \ref{fig:figure013}). Clouds with CTH are relatively easy to detect in Sentinel-2 imagery because of their high reflectance (white color) in all-optical frequency bands. Clouds with low COT and high CTH, e.g. cirrus clouds, can be detected using the cirrus band (1.36â€“1.39 $\mu$m), which has a strong water vapor absorption feature. Finally, clouds with low COT and low CTH, e.g. haze and fog, can be detected using spectral indices, such as HOT, which exploit the high correlation between blue and red bands for most clear-sky land surfaces (HOT, zhang2002). In general, clouds with low COT do not reflect all the sunlight allowing to observe a distorted view of the surface \cite{lynch2002cirrus, chen2017}. For some applications, such as object detection or disaster response\cite{Mateo-Garcia2021}, images contaminated with haze are still helpful.
